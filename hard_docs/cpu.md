CPU Name: LR35902 (official manufacturer name by Sharp) or SM83 (nickname used by GBDev community) 8-bit CPU
Details:
1. CISC: Computer Arcitecture where for every instruction in the instruction set it preforms complex, multi-step operations on the low-level.
   - Pro: Reduces the number of instructions need to complete a task -> smaller program sizes.
   - Con: Larger intruction set than an RISC, and each instruction may require more time to execute. Variable-length instruction (some take 1-byte, some 2+ bytes).
