# üéÆ GameBoy Emulator Project

A work-in-progress Game Boy emulator written in C++ 17 (focusing on accurate CPU emulation and modular architecture). This initiative is taken upon by students in
the Mathematical Computer Science and Computer Science departments at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Practices

To keep this project consistent, maintainable, and portable across different operating systems, all contributors must follow these coding guidelines.

---

### üóíÔ∏è 1. Documentation and Readability

- **Over-document your code.** Every class, function, and complex block should have clear comments explaining what it does and why.  
- Comments should help others understand your thought process, not just repeat the code.
- Use consistent naming:
  - **Classes:** CamelCase  
  - **Functions:** PascalCase or snake_case (pick one and use it everywhere)  
  - **Variables:** snake_case  
- Avoid single-letter variable names unless they‚Äôre loop counters (`i`, `j`, `k`).


### Example

```cpp
// Executes the next instruction from memory
void ExecuteNextInstruction(int cycles) {
    // Update registers and advance the program counter
}
```

## üöß Current Task
  Nothing to do yet until Lecture 1 is finalized where we'll set a clear coding objective to every collaborator. 

## üß© General Implementation:

 ### **CPU LR35902**: _(In Progress)_

     - [ ] Implement flag handling (Z,N,H,C)
     - [ ] Build instruction decoder
     - [ ] Implement instruction timing
     - [ ] Implement data transfer instructions (LD r,r ,LD r,(HL), etc.)
     - [ ] Implement arithmetic & logic instructions (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.)
